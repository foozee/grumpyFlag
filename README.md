# grumpyFlag
Chrome plugin to display country names as a title (toolbox hover) on facebook posts

# Why?
Well, uhm, I'm a memeber of a facebook group called [Grumpy Expat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/grumpyexpat) in which people would end up starting almost all posts in the format "ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬ in ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± ... " and because I'm (and so many fellow group members are) flag-illeterate, I just created this tiny plugin to tell me which country is which :D (also hence the name)

Flag-emoji mapping is based on [gemoji project](https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/db/emoji.json)
